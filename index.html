    <h1>Eugene Jeong</h1>
    <p>I am a mechanical engineering undergraduate at Cornell University. 
        This is a collection of images of my engineering projects.</p>

    <h2>Shear pin hub (Cornell Baja SAE team)</h2>
    <p>Objective: Measure the maximum torque through a driveshaft on a previous season's 2WD car.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> Shear pin hub on driveshaft </th>
            <th> Installed on car </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> <img src="images/shearhub1.jpg" width=250> </td>
            <td> <img src="images/shearhub2.jpg" width=300> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>I designed, machined, and installed this shear hub which determines the maximum driveshaft torque
        by destruction of a shear pin. The full assembly consists of a split driveshaft joined by the shear hub, 
        which is locked rotationally by a shear pin. If the torque transferred through this shaft ever exceeds 
        the rated value of the pin, the pin will break, establishing a minimum bound for the maximum torque. Different 
        pins can be placed at different distances from the axis of rotation to allow a range of torques to be tested. 
        Below is a CAD model which shows a cross sectional view of a pin resting in its bore.</p>
    <img src="images/shearhub3.jpg" width=250 class="center-img">
    <p>Result: I turned the shear hub on a lathe and machined the bores on a CNC mill, ensuring a close fit with the pins. 
        I was able to test the assembly on the car until a pin setting did not break for the given driving conditions. 
        I expect to do further testing with this system.</p>

    <h2>Continuously variable transmission assembly tool (Cornell Baja SAE team)</h2>
    <p>Objective: Create a tool to facilitate assembly of a CVT pulley</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> CVT placed in custom tool </th>
            <th> Side view of tool </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> <img src="images/tool1.jpg" width=300> </td>
            <td> <img src="images/tool2.jpg" width=300> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>I designed and manufactured this tool using aluminum and steel tube stock, and a ratchet wrench. The 
        key design feature is to use the ratchet to allow the user to lock and release a lever arm to compress a 
        spring in the CVT pulley.</p>
    <p>Result: The tool didn't quite work as planned, as the coarseness of the ratchet and geometry of the arm
        prevented it from compressing the spring in the CVT. However, the process of designing and building the
        tool taught me valuable lessons in designing something to be sturdy, useful, and manufacturable. </p>
    
    <h2>CNC manufacturing (Cornell Baja SAE team)</h2>
    <p>Objective: Produce parts needed by the team.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> CVT cam </th>
            <th> Brake and steering brackets </th>
            <th> Steering rack parts </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> <img src="images/cnc1.jpg" width=200> </td>
            <td> <img src="images/cnc2.jpg" width=250> </td>
            <td> <img src="images/cnc3.jpg" width=300> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>I manufactured these parts on a Tormach PCNC 770 using Fusion 360 CAM.</p>

    <h2> Waving cat (Mechatronics Class) </h2>
    <p>Objective: Create a piece of kinetic art that responds to the environment</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> View of finished project </th>
            <th> Internals </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> <img src="images/cat1.jpg" width=300> </td>
            <td> <img src="images/cat2.jpg" width=300> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p> I designed and built an interactive waving cat statue that responds to patting on the head
        and colored objects by changing its facial expression and waving speed. I used an Arduino to 
        control a servo motor using pulse width modulation, and receive input from a color sensor.</p>
    
    <h2> Metal additive manufacturing surface analysis (NIST Research Intern)</h2>
    <p>Objective: Analyze surface data for surfaces created by laser powder bed fusion and determine optimal segmentation method selection</p>
    <img src="images/surface1.jpg" width=300 class="center-img">
    <p>I wrote MATLAB code to identify particle boundaries on a surface created by laser powder bed 
        fusion. This image shows the result of one segmentation method compared to a reference 
        classification result. I calculated values of precision and recall for five segmentation methods, 
        which can be used to select and tune relevant parameters. I also implemented surface filtering and calculation of surface
        parameters based on ASME and ISO standards, such as areal autocovariance and core height.</p>
    <p>Result: I presented my work to my peers and NIST researchers in a colloquium at the end of my internship.</p>

    <h2> Die attach voiding analysis (Undergraduate Research) </h2>
    <p>Objective: Assist graduate student with laboratory work and study die attach properties</p>
    <img src="images/thermal1.jpg" width=300 class="center-img">
    <p>I used ANSYS Workbench to conduct parameter sweeps to determine the effect of void number 
        and size on the thermal resistance and maximum temperature in a die attach layer. I also 
        compared the effect of using shell and solid elements, and conducted a mesh convergence analysis. 
        In the lab, I learned how to use a Linseis XFA Xenonflash Apparatus to take thermal diffusivity measurements.</p>

    <h2> Pressure sensor (Micro Sensors Class) </h2>
    <p>Objective: Design a sensor suitable for monitoring well bore pressure</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> COMSOL result </th>
            <th> Plot of parametric study </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> <img src="images/sensor1.jpg" width=300> </td>
            <td> <img src="images/sensor2.jpg" width=250> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p> I designed a capacitive sensor using membrane deformation and sensitivity equations, for the pressure condition
        of a well bore environment. I created a process flow and 3D model using L-Edit and MEMS Pro, then used COMSOL
        to conduct a parametric study to determine more accurate deflection behavior.</p>
