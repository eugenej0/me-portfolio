    <p>This is a collection of images of my mechanical engineering projects.</p>

    <h2>Shear pin hub (Baja SAE team)</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> Shear pin hub on driveshaft </th>
            <th> Installed on car </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> <img src="images/shearhub1.jpg" width=250> </td>
            <td> <img src="images/shearhub2.jpg" width=300> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>I designed, machined, and installed this assembly which tests the maximum torque through a 
        driveshaft by destruction of a shear pin. Below is a CAD model which shows a cross sectional 
        view of a pin resting in its bore.</p>

    <h2>Continuously variable transmission assembly tool (Baja SAE team)</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> CVT placed in custom tool </th>
            <th> Side view of tool </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> <img src="images/tool1.jpg" width=300> </td>
            <td> <img src="images/tool2.jpg" width=300> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>I designed and manufactured this tool which was intended to aid in assembly of a CVT pulley. 
        The tool didn't quite work as planned, but the process of making it taught me valuable lessons 
        in designing something to be sturdy, useful, and easy to make.</p>
    
    <h2>CNC manufacturing (Baja SAE team)</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> CVT cam </th>
            <th> Brake and steering brackets </th>
            <th> Steering rack parts </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> <img src="images/cnc1.jpg" width=200> </td>
            <td> <img src="images/cnc2.jpg" width=250> </td>
            <td> <img src="images/cnc3.jpg" width=300> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>I manufactured these parts, and others, on a Tormach PCNC 770.</p>

    <h2> Waving cat (Mechatronics Class) </h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> View of finished project </th>
            <th> Internals </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> <img src="images/cat1.jpg" width=300> </td>
            <td> <img src="images/cat2.jpg" width=300> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p> I designed and built an interactive waving cat statue that responded to external input 
        like patting on the head. </p>

    <h2> Metal additive manufacturing surface analysis </h2>
    <img src="images/surface1.jpg" width=300 class="center-img">
    <p>I wrote MATLAB code to identify particle boundaries on a surface created by laser powder bed 
        fusion. This image shows the result of one segmentation method compared to a reference 
        classification result.</p>

    <h2> Die attach voiding analysis (Undergraduate Research) </h2>
    <img src="images/thermal1.jpg" width=300 class="center-img">
    <p>I used ANSYS Workbench to conduct parametric studies to determine the effect of void number 
        and size on the thermal resistance and maximum temperature in a die attach layer.</p>

    <h2> Pressure sensor (Micro Sensors Class) </h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> COMSOL result </th>
            <th> Plot of parametric study </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> <img src="images/sensor1.jpg" width=300> </td>
            <td> <img src="images/sensor2.jpg" width=250> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p> I designed a capacitive sensor from deformation equations, created a process flow and 
        3D model using L-Edit and MEMS Pro, and studied the effect of the geometry on deformation 
        using COMSOL.</p>
