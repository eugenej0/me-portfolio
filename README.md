# Eugene Jeong's Projects
This is a collection of images of my mechanical engineering projects.

## Shear pin hub (Baja SAE team)

I designed, machined, and installed this assembly which tests the maximum torque through a driveshaft by destruction of a shear pin. Below is a CAD model which shows a cross sectional view of a pin resting in its bore.

## Continuously variable transmission assembly tool (Baja SAE team)

I designed and manufactured this tool which was intended to aid in assembly of a CVT pulley. The tool didn't quite work as planned, but the process of making it taught me valuable lessons in designing something to be sturdy, useful, and easy to make.

## CNC manufacturing (Baja SAE team)

I manufactured these parts, and others, on a Tormach PCNC 770.

## Waving cat (Mechatronics Class)

I designed and built an interactive waving cat statue that responded to external input like patting on the head.

## Pressure sensor (Micro Sensors Class)
